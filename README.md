# Financial Sentiment Analysis : OpenAI, and Llama and GAI (Amazon Bedrock)
In this project, I am testing the accuracy of all the models and see which one is better for interpreting financial documents/news

## BERT & BART
Machine Learning Project that uses BERT Deep Learning and Encoder-Decoder NLP
NB : This ML model is Novel and may occasionally generate wrong Data

### Theoretical Background

### Installing & Usage
![description](images/cover_image.png)
1. Clone the repo to your local machine ; Open in VScode (Have Jupyter Environment installed)
2. Open Terminal and Run `pip install requirements.txt`
3. In the same terminal window, run trainer.py and then run streamlit run app.py
4. As on the window above, a stock ticker is the 4-code stock symbol i.e APPL
5. The model takes a few minutes to train and output per stock ticker
6. To understand deeply how the model works, Investigate the .ipynb file

### Limitations
1. The Framework maybe inaccurate for some sentiments analysis so the analyst needs to confirm before making final decision
